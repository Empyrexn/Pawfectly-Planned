In react.js without using classes, context is the way to create global variables and not have to pass them down a tree from parent to child.
This allows me to render the context in contextHolder and manipulate it as needed within the files. 
My plan is to update all of these once on log in or page refresh from databse, then use them as needed to avoid exccessive database calls
- AccountInfo: holds the user info once logged in
- BuddyInfo: holds buddy info once logged in
- Context: renders if a graphic is visable, will be used throughout the files
- RenderPage1: renders page numbers 
- BulletinBoard: holds notes once logged in for BulletinBoard
